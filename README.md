# A&A Care and Cleaning Services Ltd

I have put together my time and effort into building this project. I aim to improve upon it
and make it production ready for the general use by the public.

I will like to see how like minded web developers can contribute to this work in any way possible.

I am a self taught programmer and I basically do this to test myself to see the progress I have made in my journey to becoming a good web developer.
